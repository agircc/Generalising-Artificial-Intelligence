## üîç What is LPG?

**LPG (Local search for Planning Graphs)** is an automated AI planner designed to solve classical planning problems. It uses a **local search** strategy over a **planning graph** representation to efficiently generate action plans that transition a system from an initial state to a goal state.

### Key Features:

* Uses **planning graphs** to represent state-action transitions.
* Applies **local search techniques** (e.g., hill climbing, WalkSAT-like methods).
* Supports **multi-objective optimization**, including:

  * Plan length minimization
  * Time optimization (makespan)
  * Cost-sensitive planning

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use LPG?

1. **Define the problem in PDDL** (Planning Domain Definition Language):

   * A domain file (`.pddl`) describing available actions and their effects.
   * A problem file describing the initial state and the goal state.

2. **Run LPG on the PDDL input**:

   * LPG searches for valid action sequences (plans) that satisfy the goal conditions.
   * Example command:

     ```bash
     ./lpg -o domain.pddl -f problem.pddl
     ```

3. **Output**:

   * A sequence of actions (the plan).
   * Information about time, cost, and quality of the plan.

## üß† Application Scenarios

LPG is used in areas where **symbolic planning** is essential:

* **Robotics**: Task and motion planning (e.g., kitchen robot brewing tea).
* **Game AI**: NPC behavior planning in dynamic environments.
* **Workflow automation**: Scheduling tasks under constraints.
* **Logistics & Manufacturing**: Multi-agent plan coordination.

## ü§ñ How Can LPG Help LLMs?

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are great at **language reasoning** but struggle with **explicit symbolic planning**. LPG offers:

* A **structured planning backbone**: LLMs can generate high-level goals, and LPG can compute precise action plans.
* **Action verification**: LPG can validate or refine sequences suggested by LLMs.
* **Hybrid systems**: LLM + LPG = neural-symbolic agent that combines flexibility with precision.

**Example**: An LLM generates a rough plan like "Make tea ‚Üí Serve guest." LPG translates this into a grounded, valid action sequence respecting the environment and constraints.

## üß† How Can LPG Help AGI?

AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) needs to:

1. **Form plans** across diverse environments.
2. **Reason symbolically and adaptively**.
3. **Explain and justify decisions** (interpretable planning).

LPG contributes by:

* Enabling **goal-directed, explainable planning**.
* Supporting **symbolic reasoning** necessary for flexible, general-purpose intelligence.
* Acting as a **planning module** in cognitive architectures (e.g., integrating with memory, perception, language).
