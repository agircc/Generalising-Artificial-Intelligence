## üìò What is PDDL?

**PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language)** is a standard **declarative language** used in artificial intelligence to **formally describe planning problems and domains**. It was originally designed for the International Planning Competitions (IPC), and is widely supported by AI planners such as **LPG, Fast Downward, and Metric-FF**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use PDDL?

PDDL problems are defined using two separate files:

1. **Domain file (`domain.pddl`)**:

   * Describes **actions**: each action has `:preconditions` (what must be true to execute it) and `:effects` (how the world changes after it).
   * Lists **predicates**, which define what kinds of facts can be true in the world.

2. **Problem file (`problem.pddl`)**:

   * Defines the **initial state** and the **goal condition** using the predicates from the domain.
   * Specifies which domain it is using.

### Example:

**Domain (boiling tea)**:

```lisp
(define (domain tea-making)
  (:predicates (has-water) (boiled) (tea-ready))
  (:action boil
    :precondition (has-water)
    :effect (boiled))
  (:action brew
    :precondition (boiled)
    :effect (tea-ready)))
```

**Problem**:

```lisp
(define (problem make-tea)
  (:domain tea-making)
  (:init (has-water))
  (:goal (tea-ready)))
```

You run a planner (e.g. LPG) with these files to get:

```text
1. boil
2. brew
```

## ü§ñ How Does PDDL Help Large Language Models (LLMs)?

PDDL gives **structured, interpretable representations** of tasks, which helps LLMs in the following ways:

| Use Case           | Benefit                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Grounding**      | Translates LLM-generated high-level goals into executable symbolic plans     |
| **Error Checking** | Validates whether steps are logically sound and feasible                     |
| **Agent Planning** | Works as the action layer in a hybrid neural-symbolic system (LLM + planner) |
| **Simulation**     | Helps simulate real-world scenarios for training or reasoning                |

**Example**: An LLM generates "make tea" ‚Üí translates to a PDDL goal ‚Üí planner gives detailed steps.

## üß† How Does PDDL Help AGI?

AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) requires:

* **Structured reasoning**
* **Goal-directed planning**
* **Transferable knowledge**

PDDL supports AGI development by:

| Role in AGI          | Description                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modularity**       | Abstracts general world knowledge into reusable domains                                        |
| **Interpretability** | Provides explainable and auditable plans                                                       |
| **Generalization**   | Allows planners to solve new problems by reusing domain models                                 |
| **Control**          | Serves as a control layer for symbolic reasoning in cognitive architectures (e.g., SOAR, LIDA) |
