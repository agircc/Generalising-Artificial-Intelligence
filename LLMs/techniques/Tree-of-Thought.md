# Tree-of-Thought (ToT)

## Definition

Reasoning framework that explores multiple reasoning paths in a tree-like structure, enabling deliberate search through the problem space.

## Architecture

```
Problem
├── Thought 1
│   ├── Sub-thought 1.1
│   └── Sub-thought 1.2
├── Thought 2
│   ├── Sub-thought 2.1
│   └── Sub-thought 2.2
└── Thought 3
    └── Sub-thought 3.1
```

## Core Components

- **Thought Generation**: Create intermediate reasoning steps
- **State Evaluation**: Assess progress toward solution
- **Search Strategy**: Navigate through thought space
- **Backtracking**: Explore alternative paths when stuck

## Search Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Breadth-First** | Explore all paths level by level | Systematic exploration |
| **Depth-First** | Deep exploration of single path | Quick solutions |
| **Best-First** | Prioritize most promising paths | Efficient search |
| **Beam Search** | Keep top-k candidates | Balanced exploration |

## Advantages over Chain-of-Thought

- **Multiple Paths**: Explores alternatives, not just linear chains
- **Self-Correction**: Can backtrack from wrong paths
- **Strategic Planning**: Deliberate search through problem space
- **Better Performance**: Significant improvements on reasoning tasks

## Applications

- Mathematical problem solving
- Creative writing and brainstorming
- Game playing and puzzles
- Complex planning tasks
- Code generation and debugging

## Implementation

1. **Problem Decomposition**: Break into intermediate steps
2. **Thought Generation**: Generate multiple candidate thoughts
3. **Evaluation**: Score each thought's promise
4. **Search**: Navigate tree using chosen strategy
5. **Solution**: Combine best path into final answer
