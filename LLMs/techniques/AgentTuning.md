### 🧩 **Problem to Solve**

While open-source large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA-2 perform well on general NLP tasks, they **underperform in agent tasks**—complex, real-world problems that require **planning, memory, multi-step reasoning, and tool usage**.

Most previous research focused on designing prompts or frameworks for specific agent tasks. But there's a **lack of general methods to improve the intrinsic agent capabilities of LLMs** without compromising their general-purpose performance.

### 🚀 **What is AgentTuning?**

**AgentTuning** is a training method designed to enhance the **generalized agent abilities** of LLMs, while preserving their **general language understanding**.

It consists of two components:

1. **AgentInstruct Dataset**:

   * A collection of 1,866 high-quality interaction trajectories across six agent tasks (e.g., household simulation, web navigation, database manipulation).
   * Each sample includes Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and the action taken at each step.
   * Data is generated using GPT-4 and filtered based on task success.

2. **Hybrid Instruction-Tuning Strategy**:

   * Combines the AgentInstruct dataset with general instruction-following data (like ShareGPT).
   * The mixing ratio is tuned to ensure the model improves in agent tasks **without degrading its general NLP abilities**.

The fine-tuned models are called **AgentLM-7B/13B/70B**, based on the LLaMA-2 chat foundation.

### 🛠️ **How to Use AgentTuning**

1. **Build AgentInstruct**:

   * Collect diverse, high-quality trajectories from multiple real-world agent tasks.
   * Use Self-Instruct and Task Derivation to bootstrap instruction data.

2. **Apply Hybrid Fine-Tuning**:

   * Mix AgentInstruct with general-domain instruction data.
   * Fine-tune your base LLM (e.g., LLaMA-2) using the combined dataset with a weighted ratio (best: 20% agent, 80% general).

3. **Evaluate**:

   * Test the model on both **held-in** and **unseen held-out** agent tasks.
   * Ensure general capabilities (e.g., on MMLU, GSM8K) are not degraded.

### 🌐 **How to Apply This Methodology in Other Scenarios**

The **AgentTuning methodology** can be generalized to improve LLM capabilities in any domain where **multi-step decision-making** is needed. Here's how:

| Scenario                            | How to apply the methodology                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 **Tool-using Agents**            | Build a dataset of tool invocation traces and fine-tune with CoT + actions.                                    |
| 💼 **Business Workflow Automation** | Simulate multi-turn task execution (e.g., in HR, finance) and collect CoT trajectories for tuning.             |
| 🎓 **Education Tutors**             | Create datasets where tutors plan lessons or help students step-by-step, then fine-tune the model accordingly. |
| 🏥 **Clinical Decision Support**    | Collect or simulate reasoning trajectories for diagnosis/treatment and tune for multi-step planning.           |
| 🧠 **Multi-modal Agents**           | Extend the interaction format to include image/tool responses and adapt the same hybrid tuning strategy.       |

### ✅ **Takeaway Summary**

> **AgentTuning is a general-purpose method to enhance LLMs’ reasoning and planning skills for agent tasks by training on high-quality, multi-step interaction trajectories, mixed with general instruction data. It is domain-agnostic and adaptable to many real-world decision-making scenarios.**
