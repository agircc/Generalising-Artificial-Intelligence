# Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation (aLoRA)

## Definition

Advanced variant of LoRA that dynamically adjusts rank allocation across different layers and attention heads based on importance.

## Key Innovation

Unlike standard LoRA with fixed rank, aLoRA:
- **Adaptive Rank**: Different ranks for different layers
- **Importance-Based Allocation**: Higher rank for more important components
- **Dynamic Pruning**: Removes less important singular vectors during training

## Algorithm

1. **Importance Scoring**: Measure sensitivity of each parameter
2. **Rank Allocation**: Assign higher ranks to important layers
3. **Singular Vector Pruning**: Remove low-importance components
4. **Budget Redistribution**: Reallocate parameters efficiently

## Advantages over LoRA

| Aspect | LoRA | aLoRA |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Rank Assignment** | Fixed across layers | Adaptive per layer |
| **Parameter Usage** | Uniform distribution | Importance-based |
| **Performance** | Good | Better with same budget |
| **Efficiency** | Static | Dynamic optimization |

## Applications

- Large-scale model adaptation
- Resource-constrained environments
- Multi-domain fine-tuning
- Continual learning scenarios

## Performance Gains

- 10-30% better performance with same parameter budget
- More stable training dynamics
- Better preservation of pre-trained knowledge
