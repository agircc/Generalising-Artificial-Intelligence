# Specialized Memory Types in AGI Architectures

This summary outlines eight specialized memory systems discussed in the LIDA and HTM cognitive architectures. These memory types are inspired by human cognition and play different roles in processing, storing, and retrieving information in AGI systems.

---

## 1. Sensory Memory
- **Function**: Temporarily stores incoming raw sensory input.
- **Used in**: LIDA
- **Example**: Visual or auditory stimuli held briefly before further processing.

---

## 2. Perceptual Associative Memory
- **Function**: Acts as recognition memory by linking percepts with previously encountered patterns.
- **Used in**: LIDA
- **Example**: Recognizing a face based on previous experiences.

---

## 3. Current Situational Model
- **Function**: Integrates perceptual input and memory to represent the agent’s current understanding of the world.
- **Used in**: LIDA
- **Example**: Knowing you’re in a classroom and it’s time to listen.

---

## 4. Spatial Memory
- **Function**: Stores spatial relationships and environmental layouts.
- **Used in**: LIDA
- **Example**: Remembering the layout of a house or where objects are located.

---

## 5. Transient Episodic Memory
- **Function**: Temporarily stores recent events and episodes for short-term recall.
- **Used in**: LIDA
- **Example**: Remembering the last thing someone said.

---

## 6. Declarative Memory
- **Function**: Stores facts, events, and knowledge that can be explicitly recalled.
- **Used in**: LIDA
- **Example**: Knowing that Paris is the capital of France.

---

## 7. Procedural Memory
- **Function**: Stores learned rules for action and behavior ("what to do when").
- **Used in**: LIDA
- **Example**: Knowing how to ride a bicycle or respond to a medical symptom.

---

## 8. Sequence Memory
- **Function**: Learns and predicts temporal patterns in data streams.
- **Used in**: HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory)
- **Example**: Predicting the next word in a sentence or the next sensor reading in a time series.

> These memory systems collectively support complex cognitive behaviors, enabling AGI systems to perceive, learn, plan, and act in dynamic environments.
