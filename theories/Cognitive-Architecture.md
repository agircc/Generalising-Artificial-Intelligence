# Cognitive Architecture

## Definition

Cognitive architectures are computational frameworks that model the structure and processes of human cognition to create artificial intelligent systems.

## Key Components

- **Memory Systems**: Working, declarative, procedural, and episodic memory
- **Learning Mechanisms**: Chunking, reinforcement, and associative learning  
- **Reasoning Engine**: Problem-solving and inference capabilities
- **Perception Module**: Sensory input processing and pattern recognition
- **Action Selection**: Goal-directed behavior and motor control

## Major Architectures

| Architecture | Focus | Key Features |
|--------------|-------|--------------|
| **SOAR** | Problem-solving | State-operator-result, chunking |
| **ACT-R** | Cognitive modeling | Declarative/procedural memory, production rules |
| **LIDA** | Consciousness simulation | Global workspace, cognitive cycles |
| **CLARION** | Dual processing | Explicit/implicit learning, bottom-up/top-down |

## Applications

- Intelligent tutoring systems
- Human-computer interaction
- Autonomous agents
- Cognitive modeling research
