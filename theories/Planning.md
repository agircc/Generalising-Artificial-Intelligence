# 🧭 Planning in AI

## What is Planning?

**Planning** in AI refers to the process of **deciding a sequence of actions** to achieve a specific goal or solve a problem, given a model of the world, constraints, and available actions.

> 🗣️ In simple terms: Planning allows AI to *think ahead* and figure out *what to do next*.

## Types of Planning in AI

### 1. **Classical Planning**

* Assumes a fully known, static environment.
* Uses symbolic representations (e.g., STRIPS, PDDL).
* Example: Robot moves through rooms with pre-defined actions.

### 2. **Hierarchical Planning (HTN)**

* Breaks tasks into subtasks (e.g., "plan a trip" → "book flight", "book hotel").
* Supports abstraction and goal decomposition.

### 3. **Probabilistic Planning**

* Handles uncertainty in actions or environments.
* Example: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs).

### 4. **Reactive Planning**

* Responds dynamically to the environment without fixed plans.
* Used in robotics and game agents.

### 5. **Multi-Agent Planning**

* Plans coordinated strategies across multiple intelligent agents.
* Example: AI teammates in games or swarm robotics.

## Common AI Planning Methods

| Method                      | Description                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Search-Based Planning**   | Uses algorithms like A\*, BFS, DFS            |
| **GraphPlan**               | Builds a planning graph to extract a solution |
| **SAT/SMT-based**           | Converts planning into logical constraints    |
| **Reinforcement Learning**  | Learns optimal policies via trial and error   |
| **Constraint Satisfaction** | Finds action sequences satisfying constraints |

## 🧠 How Do LLMs Perform Planning?

While LLMs were not originally designed for planning, they can **simulate planning behavior** using natural language and reasoning patterns.

### ✅ Techniques for Planning with LLMs:

#### 1. **Chain-of-Thought Planning**

* Prompt LLMs to reason step-by-step:
  *“First, I will…, then I will…, finally I will…”*

#### 2. **ReAct (Reason + Act) Framework**

* LLMs generate a plan, take actions (like calling tools), then adjust based on outcomes.

#### 3. **AutoGPT / Agentic Planning**

* LLMs generate high-level goals → break them into subtasks → call APIs/tools → loop until done.
* Simulates goal-setting, prioritization, and execution.

#### 4. **Tree-of-Thought (ToT)**

* Explores multiple parallel plan paths and chooses the best outcome.
* More structured and exploratory than CoT.

#### 5. **Program-Aided Planning**

* LLMs generate code (e.g., Python functions) to simulate or plan sequences with logic and memory.

## 🔍 Challenges in LLM-Based Planning

* ❌ **Lacks long-term memory**: Hard to track long plans over many steps.
* ❌ **May hallucinate steps**: Plans might be logically inconsistent.
* ❌ **No world model**: Without grounded knowledge, plans might be infeasible.
* ✅ **Fast prototyping**: Great for flexible, natural task decomposition.

## 🧠 Why Planning Matters for AGI

* 📋 **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: AGI needs to move from intent → action via planning.
* 🧩 **Adaptability**: Plans must update when the world or goals change.
* 🤖 **Embodied Agents**: Robots or digital agents must sequence actions over time.
* 💬 **Strategic Thinking**: Enables long-term decisions beyond immediate responses.

> 🧠 Planning is the "executive function" of AGI—deciding not just *what* it knows, but *what to do with it*.
