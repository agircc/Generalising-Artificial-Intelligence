# Curriculum Learning

## Definition

Training strategy that presents examples in a meaningful order, typically from simple to complex, mimicking human learning progression.

## Core Principles

- **Progressive Difficulty**: Start with easier examples, gradually increase complexity
- **Knowledge Building**: Use previously learned concepts as foundation
- **Adaptive Pacing**: Adjust learning speed based on performance

## Curriculum Design Strategies

### Static Curricula
- **Predefined Ordering**: Fixed sequence based on domain knowledge
- **Difficulty Metrics**: Sort by complexity measures (length, entropy, etc.)

### Dynamic Curricula  
- **Self-Paced Learning**: Model selects next examples based on confidence
- **Automatic Curriculum**: Algorithm determines optimal ordering
- **Teacher-Student**: Separate model guides curriculum decisions

## Applications

| Domain | Implementation | Benefits |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Computer Vision** | Simple → complex images | Faster convergence |
| **NLP** | Short → long sequences | Better generalization |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Easy → hard environments | Stable training |
| **Neural Machine Translation** | Simple → complex sentences | Improved BLEU scores |

## Key Benefits

- Faster convergence rates
- Better final performance  
- Improved generalization
- More stable training dynamics
